Ostro still conducts technical interviews—but they look different now.
Instead of whiteboard puzzles or contrived algorithmic tests, candidates join one of our engineers in a collaborative working session. Together, they explore a meaningful technical problem that reflects the kind of work we do every day. They talk through tradeoffs, sketch solutions, write code, and adjust course as needed.

We encourage candidates to use AI tools during the session.

That is intentional. Our developers use AI daily—to scaffold ideas, debug faster, or accelerate exploration. Asking candidates not to use AI in interviews would create an artificial constraint that does not exist on the job. We want to see how candidates think, where they ask questions, how they use available tools, and how they navigate ambiguity—not how much syntax they have memorized.

The outcome is a deeper signal. Candidates get to show how they work, not just what they know. Interviewers get to observe how a potential teammate approaches a real problem. And the candidate experience feels more like co-working than a test.

The goal is simple: evaluate real-world problem solving, not test-taking. The process is collaborative, practical, and reflective of how engineering happens today.
